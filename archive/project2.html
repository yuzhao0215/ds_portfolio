<p>
    This is a followup project of Project 1. For data science project, it is important to visualize the data to
    better understand the problem. In this project, an interactive visualization website was built using Dash and Plotly. 
    You can select arbitry camera pair including a left camera and a right camera among eight cameras. 
    Then, by selecting a bubble image in left camera, the candidate bubble images in right camera will be 
    highlighted. Plus, the prediction results of the candidate particles are presented with classifiers 
    trained in Project 1.

<ul>
    <li>Dropdown 1: selects the index of left camera.</li>
    <li>Dropdown 2: selects the index of right camera.</li>
    <li>Dropdown 3: selects the index of particle in left camera.</li>
    <li>Slider 1: scale down the image resolution in case they cannot fit in page.</li>
    <li>Left image: image of left camera.</li>
