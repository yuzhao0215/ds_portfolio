Tracer particles like small bubbles are typically used to visualize airflow in Fluid Mechanics. 
To track the trajectories of bubbles, multiple cameras are needed to reconstruct the 3D coordinates of bubbles.
Before 3D reconstruction of bubbles' coordinates, it is important to correctly identify the images of each bubble across multiple cameras.  
This is a difficult task because small bubbles all look similar in cameras. To help identify corresponded bubble images in cameras 
(belong to each other (belong to a real bubble), several machine learning classifiers were used to predict the "True" or "False" of a bubble images pair. 
The results show that the neural network classifier (nn_clf) performed the best and achieved approximately 95% prediction accuracy.
