    Hello everyone! Thank you for visiting one of my Data Science Project! 
    This project aims to predict the annul corn yield using a machine learning model based on the weather such as the average perception and 
    temperature of each month. This model will help farmers to better organize their work and traders in the futures market make decisions.

<h2>Motivations</h2>

<p>
    Why am I interested in building a machine learning model to predict the corn yield? 
    First, it can be helpful for farmers for their cropping activities. 
    Second, it might help the traders in a future market to make decisions. 
    Therefore, it is important to have a machine learning model for the corn yield prediction.

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>
    We can see that there is a corn belt in the US, which is in the Midwest area. 
    To facilitate corn growth, many weather stations have been established in this area, 
    and they routinely post weather data that is critical for corn growth.

    Therefore, we  can use web scraper to get the data from the websites that publish weather data.     

    There are three different kinds of feature data collected that could be related to corn yield. 
    The first one is weather data such as rainfall, temperature, and wind speed. 
    The weather plays a great role in corn yield. 
    For example, if the rainfall is sufficient in corn’s grown season, the yield might be increased. 
    However, when the rainfall is too large to be drained, the corn yield will decrease. 
    Another example is the wind speed, 
    moderate wind speed is beneficial to evaporate the standing water in field. 
    Whereas strong wind will damage the corn plant. 
    The annually average temperature and rainfall data were collected on 
    <a href="https://mrcc.purdue.edu/CLIMATE">https://mrcc.purdue.edu/CLIMATE </a>
    between 1950-2020. 
    The wind data were collected on 
    <a href="https://www.wunderground.com">https://www.wunderground.com</a>. 
    The averaging of each year’s data was performed between April to October, 
    because corn is usually planted in April and harvested in October.
    <br>
    <br>
    The second set of data is about soil. There are several features to describe the soil moister. 
    For example, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is a long-term standardized index ranging from -10 to 10. 
    The negative values indicate the soil is dry, whereas the positive means the soil is wet. 
    The soil moister data were also collected on 
    <a href="https://mrcc.purdue.edu/CLIMATE ">https://mrcc.purdue.edu/CLIMATE </a>
    between 1950-2020. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The third set of data is corn price, the corn price is usually related with corn yield. 
    If this year’s corn price is high, more corn yield could be expected for the next year. 
    The price data were collected on 
    <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov">https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov</a>
    in Illinois from 1950-2020. 
    The corn yield data in Champaign County was also collected on 
    <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov">https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov</a>.
